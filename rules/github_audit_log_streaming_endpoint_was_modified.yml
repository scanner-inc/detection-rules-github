name: GitHub audit log streaming endpoint was modified
description: |-
  ## Goal

  Detect modifications to GitHub audit log streaming settings.

  ## Strategy

  This rule monitors changes to GitHub audit log streaming settings, as alterations could degrade an organization's security posture by disrupting the flow of audit logs into centralized storage.

  ## Triage and response

  1. Determine if the change made by the actor is authorized.
  2. If the change was not authorized or was unexpected, initiate the organization's incident response process and conduct an investigation.
