name: GitHub private repository changed to public visibility
description: |-
  ## Goal

  Detect when a GitHub repository changes its visibility to public.

  ## Strategy

  This rule monitors GitHub audit logs for changes from private to public visibility. Private repositories often contain sensitive information and should only be made public with organizational approval.

  ## Triage and response

  1. Verify if the change made by the actor is authorized.
  2. If the change is unauthorized or unexpected, initiate your organization's incident response process and conduct an investigation.
