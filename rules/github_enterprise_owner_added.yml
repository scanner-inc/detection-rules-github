name: GitHub enterprise owner added
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a GitHub enterprise owner has been added.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors GitHub audit logs for the addition of a GitHub enterprise owner. Enterprise owners have complete control over the enterprise, including:

  * Managing administrators
  * Adding and removing organizations
  * Removing enterprise members from all organizations
  * Managing enterprise settings
  * Enforcing policy across organizations
  * Managing billing settings

  Adding members to this highly privileged role should be monitored, as an attacker with unauthorized access could seek to persist by adding additional roles.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the change made by the actor is authorized.
  2. If the change was unauthorized or unexpected, initiate the organization's incident response process and investigate.
