  ## Goal

  Detect when GitHub OIDC/SAML single sign-on (SSO) has been modified.

  ## Strategy

  This rule monitors GitHub audit logs for modifications to OIDC/SAML SSO. Disabling these settings could weaken the organization's security posture.

  ## Triage and response

  1. Determine if the change made by the actor is authorized.
  2. If the change was unauthorized or unexpected, initiate the organization's incident response process and investigate.
