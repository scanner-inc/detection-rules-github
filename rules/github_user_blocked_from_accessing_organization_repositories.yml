name: GitHub user blocked from accessing organization repositories
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a GitHub user is blocked from accessing organization repositories.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors GitHub audit logs for instances where a user is blocked from accessing organization repositories. Organization owners and moderators can block non-members from collaborating.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the change made by the actor is authorized.
  2. If the change was unauthorized or unexpected, initiate your organization's incident response process and investigate.
