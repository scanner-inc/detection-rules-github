name: GitHub audit log streaming endpoint was deleted
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a GitHub audit log stream has been deleted.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors GitHub audit logs for the deletion of an audit log stream. An attacker may remove a stream to evade defenses set up by a security team.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Determine if the change made by the actor is authorized.
  2. If the change was unauthorized or unexpected, initiate your organization's incident response process and investigate.
