name: GitHub MFA requirement disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when GitHub multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements have been disabled.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors GitHub audit logs for instances when MFA requirements are disabled, allowing members to access an enterprise or organization without two-factor authentication. This action could enable attackers to maintain persistent access to compromised accounts.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Determine if the change made by the actor is authorized.
  2. If the change is unauthorized or unexpected, initiate your organization's incident response process and investigate.
