name: GitHub unknown user cloned private repository
description: |-
  ## Goal

  Detect when an unknown actor clones a GitHub repository.

  ## Strategy

  This rule monitors GitHub audit logs for repository clones where the actor is unspecified.

  ## Triage and response

  1. Check if the IP address associated with the clone action belongs to a known corporate device.
  2. If the action cannot be traced back to an internal user, initiate your organization's incident response process and conduct an investigation.
